<p>Voronoi diagrams are a way of partitioning a plane into a series of regions defined by the location of a set of points, often referred to as ‘seeds’. In a Voronoi diagram, every seed is surrounded by a region that covers the area of the plane that is closer to that seed than any other.</p>
<p>When these diagrams are overlaid onto maps or analysed alongside other data, they can reveal valuable insights - for instance, voronoi diagrams are used in sports analytics to identify how the movement of football players can open or close down space; retailers use voronoi diagrams to identify where they can open a new store with a large population catchment.</p>
<p>Voronoi diagrams are easy to produce in R using the <code>sf</code> package. In this post, I’ll be creating a voronoi diagram to analyse sales of flats in London.</p>
<div id="the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>The Data</h2>
<p>The data comes from the Land Registry, who publish the details of every residential property sale in the United Kingdom. It’s possible to download yearly and historic files from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads#yearly-file">here</a>.</p>
<p>For this analysis, we’ll look at 2018 and 2019 sales only. Note that the data records the property type of each transaction, coded as “D” for detached, “S” for semi-detached, “T” for terrace, “F” for flat and “O” for other. We’ll remove other from the data here.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)

house_prices &lt;- house_prices %&gt;% filter(property_type %in% c(&quot;D&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;F&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><strong>Extracting London’s Sales</strong></p>
<p>While the data contains the postcode of every property, it is not geocoded. Fortunately, there is a csv of every London postcode and a rough latitude and longitude available to download <a href="https://www.doogal.co.uk/london_postcodes.php">here</a>.</p>
<p>By using <code>inner_join()</code> on the <code>house_prices</code> and <code>postcodes</code> data, we can return all records that occur in both datasets. This leaves us with all property sales with a London postcode, which are also now geocoded.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>postcodes &lt;- data.table::fread(&quot;London postcodes.csv&quot;) %&gt;% 
  select(&quot;postcode&quot; = 1, &quot;lat&quot; = Latitude, &quot;long&quot; = Longitude) %&gt;% 
  mutate(postcode = str_replace_all(postcode, &quot; &quot;, &quot;&quot;))

house_prices$postcode &lt;- str_replace_all(house_prices$postcode, &quot; &quot;, &quot;&quot;)

house_prices &lt;- house_prices %&gt;% 
  inner_join(postcodes, by = &quot;postcode&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Reading in shape files of London’s boroughs and wards</strong></p>
<p>We’ll want to visualise the property sales on a map, so we’ll also read in two shape files - one of London’s 33 boroughs, and one of the capital’s c. 630 wards.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(sf)

london_boroughs &lt;- read_sf(&quot;london map&quot;, &quot;London_Borough_Excluding_MHW&quot;) %&gt;% 
  select(&quot;la_name&quot; = 1, &quot;la_code&quot; = 2) %&gt;% 
  st_transform(crs = 27700)

  st_transform(crs = 27700)</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we’ll convert the house prices data to a spatial dataframe object, so we can use the <code>sf</code> functions on the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>house_prices_sf &lt;- st_as_sf(house_prices, coords = c(&quot;long&quot;, &quot;lat&quot;), crs = 4326) %&gt;%

<h2>How Much Does a Flat Cost in Tower Hamlets?</h2>
<p>Tower Hamlets is a large London borough that stretches from the edge of the City of London in the west, to Canary Wharf and Stratford in the east.</p>
<p>The median price of a flat in Tower Hamlets is around £465,000. Though as we can see from the density plot below, there’s a good deal of variation in flat prices.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(scales)

<p><strong>Visualising the data</strong></p>
<p>One way of interrogating the data is to summarise the flat prices by ward, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wards_and_electoral_divisions_of_the_United_Kingdom">a small(ish) unit of geography in the UK</a>. We can see from the map below that flat prices are more expensive in the west of Tower Hamlets, which borders on the City of London. However, we can’t tell from this visualisation where the individual sales took place. Nor can we tell how many sales there were in each ward or where in the ward they took place.</p>
<p>More fundamentally, wards are an arbitrary division of geography. They don’t have any real relationship with our data, and most Londoners would struggle to tell you which ward they live in (by contrast, almost everyone knows which Borough they live in).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tower_hamlets_prices %&gt;% 
  st_join(x = london_wards %&gt;% filter(la_name == &quot;Tower Hamlets&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  group_by(ward_name) %&gt;% 
  summarise(median_price = median(price)) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(fill = median_price)) + 
  geom_sf() + 
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = &quot;Spectral&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/project/2020-01-07-using-voronoi-diagrams-to-analyse-property-sales_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can resolve this to an extent by plotting the individual sales, but there’s so much overlap between the points it’s difficult to pick out any real trends here. It is noteworthy, however, that there are large gaps in the map where no sales occurred, likely due to these areas being occupied by office blocks, retail spaces, green spaces or other non-residential uses.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>breaks &lt;- c(seq(0, 4*10^6, 2*10^5))

tower_hamlets_prices %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(color = price), alpha = 0.4) +

  scale_color_distiller(palette = &quot;Spectral&quot;, trans = &quot;log&quot;, breaks = breaks) +

<p><strong>Using a Voronoi Diagram</strong></p>
<p>Enter the Voronoi diagram. Using the <code>st_voronoi()</code> function from the <code>sf</code> package, we can generate a new geometry based on where the sales occurred, allowing us to examine how concentrated sales are in particular areas. When visualising the data, we can also colour-code the Voronoi cell according to sale price, which will reveal how prices vary in different locations.</p>
<p>One thing to bear in mind is that Voronoi diagrams rely on unique coordinates, which our data doesn’t have. As many properties share the same postcode, they’ll have the same latitude and longitude. To remedy this, we’ll apply a very small jitter to each point using the <code>st_jitter()</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tower_hamlets_jitter &lt;- tower_hamlets_prices %&gt;% st_jitter(factor = 0.001)</code></pre>
<p>We can then create the Voronoi geometry using the code below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tower_hamlets_voronoi &lt;- tower_hamlets_jitter %&gt;% 
  st_union() %&gt;% 
  st_voronoi() %&gt;% 
  st_collection_extract(type = &quot;POLYGON&quot;) %&gt;% 
  st_sf(crs = 27700) %&gt;% 
  st_intersection(st_intersection(london_boroughs %&gt;% filter(la_name == &quot;Tower Hamlets&quot;)))

tower_hamlets_voronoi &lt;- tower_hamlets_voronoi %&gt;% st_join(tower_hamlets_jitter)</code></pre>
<p>We can then visualise the data using <code>geom_sf()</code>. The resulting visualisation makes a couple trends clearer than the previous dot plot and choropleth.</p>
<p>First, looking at the south of the outline of Tower Hamlets, which borders the river Thames, we can see a narrow band of very expensive flats. These flats, located on the river, generally sold for more than £1 million.</p>
<p>Second, we can see that there are quite a few sales of flats for somewhere between £100,000 and £200,000 in the Borough - a steep discount from the median flat price. It looks as though there were more of these sales in the far east of Tower Hamlets, which borders on Stratford; and in the very South, in an area called Millwall.</p>
<p>Third, looking closely there are some highly concentrated areas where many properties close together were transacted - this is possibly due to new flats in a development being brought to market, which may have all been sold around the same time.</p>

An alternative way of visualising the data is to use a diverging colour scale centred around the median flat price. Here, we can see in red the concentration of sales above the median flat price in the western and southern parts of Tower Hamlets, compared with greater concentration of blue tones in the east.</p>

<p>We can easily take our Voronoi geometry and overlay it onto a map using the <code>leaflet</code> package. This has the added benefit that we can use a tooltip to surface the price of any transaction when we hover over the geometry. This makes it easier to pick out the extreme values, including those flats which sold for less than £100,000.</p>

<div id="using-stations-as-the-voronoi-seeds" class="section level2">
<h2>Using Stations as the Voronoi Seeds</h2>
<p>An alternative approach to the above method is to use stations as the seeds of the Voronoi diagrams, and then aggregate property transactions within each of the resulting Voronoi cells.</p>
<p>In many ways, this is a more intuitive way of analysing locations - people tend to be much more familiar with the area around their closest station than they would be with the borough or ward they live in, and will often look to move to or buy a property close to a station that offers them an easier commute.</p>
<p>Doogle.co.uk provides a full list of all the stations in London, including both underground, overground and main line stations. We’ll read this in now.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>stations &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://www.doogal.co.uk/LondonStationsCSV.ashx&quot;) %&gt;%

<p><strong>How much does a flat cost in west London?</strong></p>
<p>Hounslow, Ealing and Brent are three boroughs located in outer west London. These areas encompass a broad range of neighbourhoods - including locations like Feltham, which boarders Heathrow airport; Chiswick, a leafy suburb on the river Thames; and Queens Park, a highly-desirable and expensive area north of Kensington.</p>
<p>We’ll here create a new Voronoi diagram using the stations located in these three London boroughs. This divides the boroughs into Voronoi 65 cells, one for each station.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>west_map &lt;- london_boroughs %&gt;%

<p>We’ll now join this Voronoi diagram with the housing transactions, looking again only at sales of flats. For each station, we’ll calculate the median house price and number of sales in the surrounding area.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>west_voronoi &lt;- west_voronoi %&gt;%

  summarise(price = median(price),
            number_sales = n()) %&gt;%

<p>We’ll again use leaflet to visualise the Voronoi diagram. Note that the dots here show the location of the stations.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>color_pal &lt;- colorNumeric(log(west_voronoi_summarised$price), palette = &quot;YlGnBu&quot;, reverse = TRUE)

              label = ~paste0(

                &quot;Sale price: &quot;, dollar(price, prefix = &quot;£&quot;), &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;,
                &quot;Number of sales: &quot;, comma(number_sales)) %&gt;% lapply(htmltools::HTML)
              )</code></pre>
<div id="htmlwidget-2" style="width:100%;height:480px;" class="widgetframe html-widget"></div>

<p>The main take-away here is that locations in the west of the diagram (such as Feltham, Southall and Northolt) are considerably cheaper than locations in the west (such as Turnham Green, Chiswick Park and Kensal Rise).</p>
<p>However, the more interesting cells are those whose colours contrast with their immediate neighbours. On this reading, Gunnersbury, with a median price of £426,000, looks cheap compared to neighbouring Kew Bridge and Chiswick Park, where median prices in 2018/19 where £530,000 and £590,000 respectively. Similarly, the median flat price in Willesden Green was £435,000, compared with £369,000 in neighbouring Dollis Hill.</p>
<p>Ealing Broadway, where the median flat price was £514,000, looks expensive compared to its neighbouring Voronoi cells, though this may be due to the station being served by both the Central and District underground lines, as well as national services.</p>
