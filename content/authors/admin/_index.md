*Hi, I'm Owen*

I'm a quantitative researcher in the property sector, based in London. In my professional work, I apply skills in data visualisation, geospatial analysis, automation and machine learning to generate insights, automate processes and create new products. 

This site is a collection of my personal projects, mainly written in R. My R code makes extensive use of the Tidyverse, ggplot and R Shiny. I also have experience in package development and apply the principals of functional programming across my work.
